# AI_Workshop
From a workshop I attended on Artificial-Intelligence.

We had a hands-on experience during the workshop.
The following topics were covered:
* Image Processing
* Face Detection
* Face Recognition
* Emotion Recognition

The opencv_sample folder consists of the basics of image processing.
The test images are stored in standard_test_images mentioned in the .gitignore file.

The test images for Face_Detection are stored in test_images folder mentioned in the .gitignore file.

The trained images captured by create_database.py for Face_Recognition are stored in Database folder mentioned in the .gitignore file.

The trained images for Emotion_Recognition are stored in Dataset folder mentioned in the .gitignore file.

(All these files weren't pushed because of their size of course!!)
